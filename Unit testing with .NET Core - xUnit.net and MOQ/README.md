### Unit Testing

Unit testing is a software testing practice where individual units or components of the code are tested in isolation. The goal is to validate that each unit functions as expected.

### Integration Testing

Integration testing is a type of software testing where individual units are combined and tested as a group. The goal is to verify that the units work together correctly.

### Automated Testing

Automated testing refers to software tests that are executed automatically, without manual intervention. They are often used in conjunction with agile development practices to ensure code quality.

#### Load Testing

Load testing is a type of performance testing where the software is subjected to a significant workload to evaluate its behavior under intensive use conditions.
